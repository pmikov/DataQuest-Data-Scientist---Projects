    "# DATA CLEANING\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will walk through the full data science life cycle, from data cleaning and feature selection to machine learning. We will focus on credit modelling, a well known data science problem that focuses on modeling a borrower's credit risk. Credit has played a key role in the economy for centuries and some form of credit has existed since the beginning of commerce. We'll be working with financial lending data from Lending Club. Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return. You can read more about their marketplace here.\n",
    "\n",
    "While Lending Club has to be extremely savvy and rigorous with their credit modelling, investors on Lending Club need to be equally as savvy about determining which loans are more likely to be paid off. While at first, you may wonder why investors would put money into anything but low interest loans. The incentive investors have to back higher interest loans is, well, the higher interest! If investors believe the borrower can pay back the loan, even if he or she has a weak financial history, then investors can make more money through the larger additional amount the borrower has to pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most investors use a portfolio strategy to invest small amounts in many loans, with healthy mixes of low, medium, and interest loans. In this course, we'll focus on the mindset of a conservative investor who only wants to invest in the loans that have a good chance of being paid off on time. To do that, we'll need to first understand the features in the dataset and then experiment with building machine learning models that reliably predict if a loan will be paid off or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Introduction to the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Lending Club releases data for all of the approved and declined loan applications periodically on their [website](https://www.lendingclub.com/auth/login?login_url=%2Fstatistics%2Fadditional-statistics%3F). You can select a few different year ranges to download the datasets (in CSV format) for both approved and declined loans.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also find a data dictionary (in XLS format) which contains information on the different column names towards the bottom of the page. We recommend downloading the data dictionary to so you can refer to it whenever you want to learn more about what a column represents in the datasets. Here's a link to the data dictionary file hosted on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191B2yJ4H1ZPXq0_ByhUgWMFZOYem5jFz0Y3by_7YBY4/edit).\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into the datasets themselves, let's get familiar with the data dictionary. The LoanStats sheet describes the approved loans datasets and the RejectStats describes the rejected loans datasets. Since rejected applications don't appear on the Lending Club marketplace and aren't available for investment, we'll be focusing on data on approved loans only.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approved loans datasets contain information on current loans, completed loans, and defaulted loans. Let's now define the problem statement for this machine learning project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start doing machine learning, we need to define what features we want to use and which column represents the target column we want to predict. Let's start by reading in the dataset and exploring it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Reading in to Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In this mission, we'll focus on approved loans data from 2007 to 2011, since a good number of the loans have already finished. In the datasets for later years, many of the loans are current and still being paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have reduced the size of the dataset to make it easier to work with, by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- removing the desc column:\n",
    "    - which contains a long text explanation for each loan\n",
    "- removing the url column:\n",
    "    - which contains a link to each loan on Lending Club which can only be accessed with an investor account\n",
    "- removing all columns containing more than 50% missing values:\n",
    "    - which allows us to move faster since we can spend less time trying to fill these values\n",
    "\n",
    "First things first, let's read in the dataset into a Dataframe so we can start to explore the data and explore the remaining features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read loans_2007.csv into a DataFrame named loans_2007 and use the print function to display the first row of the Dataframe.\n",
    "- Use the print function to:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are 8 different possible values for the loan_status column. You can read about most of the different loan statuses on the Lending Clube webste. The two values that start with \"Does not meet the credit policy\" aren't explained unfortunately. A quick Google search takes us to explanations from the lending community here.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've compiled the explanation for each column as well as the counts in the Dataframe in the following table:\n",
    "<img src=\"data/credit4.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "From the investor's perspective, we're interested in trying to predict which loans will be paid off on time and which ones won't be. Only the Fully Paid and Charged Off values describe the final outcome of the loan. The other values describe loans that are still ongoing and where the jury is still out on if the borrower will pay back the loan on time or not. While the Default status resembles the Charged Off status, in Lending Club's eyes, loans that are charged off have essentially no chance of being repaid while default ones have a small chance. You can read about the difference here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're interested in being able to predict which of these 2 values a loan will fall under, we can treat the problem as a binary classification one. Let's remove all the loans that don't contain either Fully Paid and Charged Off as the loan's status and then transform the Fully Paid values to 1 for the positive case and the Charged Off values to 0 for the negative case. While there are a few different ways to transform all of the values in a column, we'll use the Dataframe method replace. According to the documentation, we can pass the replace method a nested mapping dictionary in the following format:\n",
    "<img src=\"data/credit5.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, one thing we need to keep in mind is the class imbalance between the positive and negative cases. While there are 33,136 loans that have been fully paid off, there are only 5,634 that were charged off. This class imbalance is a common problem in binary classification and during training, the model ends up having a strong bias towards predicting the class with more observations in the training set and will rarely predict the class with less observations. The stronger the imbalance, the more biased the model becomes. There are a few different ways to tackle this class imbalance, which we'll explore later.\n",

    "We spent the last 2 missions cleaning and preparing a dataset that contains data on loans made to members of Lending Club. Our eventual goal is to generate features from the data, which can feed into a machine learning algorithm. The algorithm will make predictions about whether or not a loan will be paid off on time, which is contained in the loan_status column of the clean dataset.\n",

    "In the last mission, we noticed that there's a class imbalance in our target column, loan_status. There are about 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (positive case, label of 1) than those that weren't (negative case, label of 0). Imbalances can cause issues with many machine learning algorithms, where they appear to have high accuracy, but actually aren't learning from the training data. Because of its potential to cause issues, we need to keep the class imbalance in mind as we build machine learning models.\n",

    "## 2. Picking an error metric\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into predicting loan_status with machine learning, let's go back to our first steps when we started cleaning the Lending Club dataset. You may recall the original question we wanted to answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "We established that this is a binary classification problem in the first mission of this course, and we converted the loan_status column to 0s and 1s as a result. Before diving in and selecting an algorithm to apply to the data, we should select an error metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "An error metric will help us figure out when our model is performing well, and when it's performing poorly. To tie error metrics all the way back to the original question we wanted to answer, let's say we're using a machine learning model to predict whether or not we should fund a loan on the Lending Club platform. Our objective in this is to make money -- we want to fund enough loans that are paid off on time to offset our losses from loans that aren't paid off. An error metric will help us determine if our algorithm will make us money or lose us money.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're primarily concerned with false positives and false negatives. Both of these are different types of misclassifications. With a false positive, we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't. This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a diagram to simplify the concepts:\n",
    "<img src=\"data/credit6.jpg\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the loan_status and prediction columns, a 0 means that the loan wouldn't be paid off on time, and a 1 means that it would.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives. A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible. They'd be more okay with missing out on opportunities (false negatives) than they would be with funding a risky loan (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate false positives and true positives in Python. We can use multiple conditionals, separated by a & to select items in a NumPy array that meet certain conditions. For instance, if we had an array called predictions, we could select items in predictions that equal 1 and where items in loans[\"loan_status\"] in the same position also equal 1 using this:\n",
    "- tp_filter = (predictions == 1) & (loans[\"loan_status\"] == 1)\n",
    "- predictions[tp_filter]\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code will give us all the items in predictions that are true positives -- where we predicted that the loan would be paid off on time, and it was actually paid off on time. By using the len function to find the number of items, we can find the number of true positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the diagram above as a reference, it's possible to compute the other 3 quantities we mentioned -- false positives, true negatives, and false negatives."

    "## 4. Class imbalance\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned earlier that there is a significant class imbalance in the loan_status column. There are 6 times as many loans that were paid off on time (1), than loans that weren't paid off on time (0). This causes a major issue when we use accuracy as a metric. This is because due to the class imbalance, a classifier can predict 1 for every row, and still have high accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above diagram, our predictions are 85.7% accurate -- we've correctly identified loan_status in 85.7% of cases. However, we've done this by predicting 1 for every row. What this means is that we'll actually lose money. Let's say we loan out 1000 dollars on average to each borrower. Each borrower pays us 10% interest back. So we make a projected profit of 100 dollars on each loan. We made 600 dollars in interest from the borrowers that paid us back, but we lost 1000 dollars on the one borrower who never paid us back, so we actually ended up losing 400 dollars overall, even though our model is technically accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it's important to always be aware of imbalanced classes in machine learning models, and to adjust your error metric accordingly. In this case, we don't want to use accuracy, and should instead use metrics that tell us the number of false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we should optimize for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- high recall (true positive rate)\n",
    "- low fall-out (false positive rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate false positive rate and true positive rate, using the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false negatives, and false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "False positive rate is the number of false positives divided by the number of false positives plus the number of true negatives. This divides all the cases where we thought a loan would be paid off but it wasn't by all the loans that weren't paid off:\n",
    "- fpr = fp / (fp + tn)\n",
    "\n",
    "True positive rate is the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives. This divides all the cases where we thought a loan would be paid off and it was by all the loans that were paid off:\n",
    "- tpr = tp / (tp + fn)\n",

    "<img src = \"data/credit7.jpg\">\n",

    "\n",
    "- False Positive Rate: \"the percentage of the loans that shouldn't be funded that I would fund\".\n",
    "- True Positive Rate: \"the percentage of loans that should be funded that I would fund\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, if we want to reduce false positive rate, true positive rate will also go down. This is because if we want to reduce the risk of false positives, we wouldn't think about funding riskier loans in the first place.\n",

    "## 8. Penalizing the classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the last screen, our fpr and tpr are around what we'd expect if the model was predicting all ones. We can look at the first few rows of predictions to confirm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, even though we're not using accuracy as an error metric, the classifier is, and it isn't accounting for the imbalance in the classes. There are a few ways to get a classifier to correct for imbalanced classes. The two main ways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use oversampling and undersampling to ensure that the classifier gets input that has a balanced number of each class.\n",
    "- Tell the classifier to penalize misclassifications of the less prevalent class more than the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look into oversampling and undersampling first. They involve taking a sample that contains equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0, and where loan_status is 1. This way, the classifier is forced to make actual predictions, since predicting all 1s or all 0s will only result in 50% accuracy at most.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of this technique is that since it has to preserve an equal ratio, you have to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throw out many rows of data. If we wanted equal numbers of rows where loan_status is 0 and where loan_status is 1, one way we could do that is to delete rows where loan_status is 1.\n",
    "- Copy rows multiple times. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to copy rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "- Generate fake data. One way to equalize the 0s and 1s is to generate new rows where loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of these techniques are especially easy. The second method we mentioned earlier, telling the classifier to penalize certain rows more, is actually much easier to implement using scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this by setting the class_weight parameter to balanced when creating the LogisticRegression instance. This tells scikit-learn to penalize the misclassification of the minority class during the training process. The penalty means that the logistic regression classifier pays more attention to correctly classifying rows where loan_status is 0. This lowers accuracy when loan_status is 1, but raises accuracy when loan_status is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "By setting the class_weight parameter to balanced, the penalty is set to be inversely proportional to the class frequencies. You can read more about the parameter here. This would mean that for the classifier, correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 0 is 6 times more important than correctly classifying a row where loan_status is 1.\n",
